## **Project Overview**

_Briefly describe the concept of your project._
My project is based around the summer theme, in which people anonymously place their submissions into a public archive of their plans! So the format that I wanted to follow was one in which itâ€™s a postcard submission format in which has been changed to be as interactive as possible. Each submission should include a small animation for when these submissions are placed and stored it so it can be showcased for others to see. 


## **Features**

_List the key features of the project (the three distinct types of user interactions)._
A loading page in which the user is prompted to interact before moving on to the next part of the assignment. Another feature would be the postcard interaction, where animations and design are taken into account when the user is prompted to put their response in. Finally, the information and data is stored for everyone to see as its displayed on the main page. 

## **Technologies Used**

_List the technologies and tools used in the project (ie. APIs, libraries, frameworks, etc.)._
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Node JS server, Glitch (It's glitchy), MongoDB Atlas, SVGs from W3, Animations with keyframes

## **Future Enhancements**

_List any future enhancements you would like to make or improve given more time._
Future enhancements I would add in the future would be including a more complete page in which there are more features for the user to have at their disposal for more interactivity. Perhaps creating more animations and even sound effects so the user can be immersed.

## **Credits**

_List any third-party assets used in the project (e.g., sound effects, images, fonts) and provide proper attribution. Acknowledge any resources, tutorials, or references you used to help complete the project._
SVGs from W3, W3 schools, MDN Web docs, Gemini from Google for assisting in the upload to ,Glitch but clearly AI isn't the best for that at all,

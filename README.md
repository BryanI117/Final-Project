# MEDP 33100 Project 2: Data Visualization
## **Project Members**

Me, Myself and I, Bryan Iturbide

## **Link to Live Page**

Still working on it

## **Project Overview**

My project is based around the summer theme, in which people anonymously place their submissions into a public archive of their plans! So the format that I wanted to follow was one in which itâ€™s a postcard submission format in which has been changed to be as interactive as possible. Each submission should include a small animation for when these submissions are placed and stored it so it can be showcased for others to see. 


## **Features**

A loading page in which the user is prompted to interact before moving on to the next part of the assignment. Another feature would be the postcard interaction, where animations and design are taken into account when the user is prompted to put their response in. Finally, the information and data is stored for everyone to see as its displayed on the main page. 

## **Technologies Used**

HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Node JS server, Glitch (It's glitchy), MongoDB Atlas, SVGs from W3, Animations with keyframes

## **Future Enhancements**

Future enhancements I would add in the future would be including a more complete page in which there are more features for the user to have at their disposal for more interactivity. Perhaps creating more animations and even sound effects so the user can be immersed.

## **Credits**
